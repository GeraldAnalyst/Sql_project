#  Background
Driven by the quest to navigate the Data scientist job market effectively. The aim of this project was to pinpoint the top paying job in data science job market and valuable skills required for the job roles and provide insight on the ones in high demand and with lucrative salaries.

Data source is from a tutor [SQl tutorial](https://lukeb.co/sql_project_csvs). It's a rich dataset with insight on job titles, job location, average salary, job posted date, essential skills and companies. 

# Tool I used
To work on this project I harnessed the power of several tools:

**SQL**: The backbone of my analysis allowing me to query the database and unravel actionable insights.

**PostgreSQL**: The ideal database management system I chose for handling job postings dataset.

**Visual studio code**: My preferred databse management and executing SQL queries.

**Git and GitHub**: Essential platform for storing, manage and share repositories of my work and allows issue tracking, code review, pull request and project management.

**Tableau**: Data visualization tool which was very useful in this project. 

# The Analysis
This part displays the queries that addresses the questions of this project aiming at investigating specific aspects of data scientist job market. Here's how i approached the questions.

### 1. Top paying Data Scientist jobs
To identify the top paying data scientist jobsüíº, I filtered Data scientist role from the dataset, positioned it with average yearly salary and location, focusing on the job work from home (remote).
The idea is to determine which Data scientist role earns highest average yearly salary compared to others. Here is the queries.

 ```sql
 SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_schedule_type,
    job_location,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name

FROM
     job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON company_dim.company_id = job_postings_fact.company_id
WHERE job_title_short = 'Data Scientist' AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
Here is the breakdown of the top data scientist jobs in the year 2023.

**Salary range**: The top data scientist role span from $300,000 to $550,000 average yearly salary, indicating a significant salary potential in this field.

**Location wise**: These jobs are offered anywhere, whether remote or onsite, which provide potenntial opportunities for those who prefers working remotely and not onsite.

**Diverse Employer**: The companies that are among those offering high salaries for these roles are like *Selby Jennings*, *Algo Capital Group*, *Demandbase*, *Reddit* and *Storm4*, which indicates that there is a broad interest across different industries.

**Job title variety**: There is a variety in job title, from Staff Data scientist/Quant researcher, Staff Data scientist/Business analytics, Head of Data scienc, Principal Data scientist among others. These shows that there are varied specialization roles within Data scientist job.

## 2. Top paying job skills
To investigate the top paying job skills I built a CTEs by conducting a left join of company_dim and job_postings_fact dataset. Later on, I join the CTEs with other two dataset(skills_job_dim & skills_dim) to provide detail for high paying skill required. This helps the job seeker to understand which skiils to develop that aligns with top salaries. 
Here's my queries:
```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT
        job_id,
        job_title,
        salary_year_avg,
        name AS company_name
    FROM
        job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON company_dim.company_id = job_postings_fact.company_id
    WHERE job_title_short = 'Data Scientist' AND
        job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)

SELECT
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills
FROM
    top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY 
    salary_year_avg DESC
```

üöÄHere is the breakdown of the highly paid skills for data scientist jobs
- SQL is the leading most sought and highly paid skills with the high average salary.
- Tableau, spark, hadoop, cassandra are among the top 5 highly paid skills for data scientist.
- Pythonüêç follows with almost the same average yearly salary and is also the most soughts skill.

## 3. Top demanded skills
The query below helped in identifying the most requested skills for Data scientist jobs in job postings by the companies.

Here's the query 

```sql
SELECT
    skills,
    COUNT(skills_dim.skill_id) AS in_demand_count

FROM
    job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE job_title_short = 'Data Scientist' 
GROUP BY 
    skills
ORDER BY 
    in_demand_count DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
Here is the breakdown of the top demanded skills for data scientist.
The top 5 skills most requested by companies are python, SQL, R, sas  and Tableau.
- **Python**: ranks first in several popularity indexes. Python‚Äôs suitability for data analysis tasks, along with powerful libraries like pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib, makes it a central pillar in many companies‚Äô tech stacks.
- **SQL**: Data scientists use SQL to retrieve, manipulate, and analyze data stored in relational databases(ranked second).
- **R programming**: ranked third and is another powerful language for data analysis and statistical modeling. It excels in exploratory data analysis, visualization, and statistical tests.
- **SAS**: Although less popular than Python and R, SAS (Statistical Analysis System) remains relevant in certain industries. It‚Äôs widely used in *healthcare*, *finance*, and *government sectors*. Ranked 4th most sought skills for data scientist.

## 4. Top paying skills
In this section we are determining the skills based on salary contrary to the second section which was investigating the skills for the top paying data scientist roles. 
Note this to avoid confusion. So we are looking at average salary associated with each skill for data scientist. Trying to reveal how different skills impact salary levels i.e. the most financially rewarding skills. 

Here's my query
 ```sql
SELECT
    skills,
    ROUND(Avg(salary_year_avg), 0) AS avg_salary
 FROM job_postings_fact
 INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
 INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE job_title_short = 'Data Scientist' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
    skills
ORDER BY 
    avg_salary DESC
LIMIT 25
 ```
Here's the breakdown of the results and actionable insight.

**Skill Development**: Consider investing time in learning and improving skills that are in demand. For example:
If you‚Äôre interested in data manipulation and analysis, explore tools like **dplyr** (**average salary: $163,111**).
For natural language processing, dive into **Hugging Face** (average salary: $160,868).
